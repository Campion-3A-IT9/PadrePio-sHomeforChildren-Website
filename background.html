			<h4>Background of PPHC:</h4>
			<p class = "part">
	      Our partner institution , PPHC , is an institution who takes care of children who need help like kids who ran from an abusive home or kids on the street caused by abandonment and etc. Such institution is also non-profit. Yet no matter how perfect this institution may seem , they still have problems that bother them. Like kids having low education knowledge and the institution having barely any sponsors that help them give money which is probably the reason why the kids don’t have a good education since there isn’t enough money to help educate them in the first place. We have a proposed solution though , HHC or Heal , Help and Care. This solution overall helps the institution and the kids by donating funds to the institution and education materials for the kids. This project plans to try to hit these 2 problems using one stone. Well thanks for reading our overall plans and goals!

			<h4>Significance & Problem:</h4>
			<p class = "part">
	       Knowing that kids in PPHC has barely any educational knowledge because of PPHC barely having any sponsors, which is a big problem , the significance
 of our project ( which is the solution ) is that due to the problem solving
actions we didto defuse the bomb powered by the problems , PPHC's flow would be much smoother now which helps them reach their goal ( that helps us and them ) and due to that ,
 our future society is saved since the future generation was taught well by PPHC with our and our project's help.

		<h3>ABOUT THE DESIGNER:</h3>				
		<div class="bg-designer">
		<h4 class = "about">
Cedrick Alper Jao is an 9th Grade Student of Ateneo De Davao University , who really likes to draw and learn tons of theories/paradoxes/facts.
He's from the Phillipines , Mindanao , Davao Region 11. The reason he vouched for the project is that he wanted the future society to be well built
by the future generation. He also wanted the kids there in PPHC to be healthy , not left in the dust left by the storm of trauma. That's what we
know about him!</h4>
